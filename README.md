# Markdown to HTML parser
A simple Markdown to HTML parser.

# Why?
Just a fun and interesting project to exercise and improve programming skills.

The original idea from an interview question where it was asked to do this exact thing without 
	using regular expressions. It isn't an easy task, that's why it's interesting! However we
	can't be completely  unrealistic and we'll be using a better solution in the future.
	
# What are the conditions?
There are only two restrictions: 
1. No regular expressions
2. Input is a stream of characters

In the future we might lift this in some way.
